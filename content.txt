always in|If you have to be in the market at all times, either long or short, this is whatever your current position is (always-in long or always-in short). If at any time you are forced to decide between initiating a long or a short trade and are confident in your choice, then the market is in always-in mode at that moment. Almost all of these trades require a spike in the direction of the trend before traders will have confidence.
barbwire|A trading range of three or more bars that largely overlap and one or more is a doji. It is a type of tight trading range with prominent tails and often relatively large bars. Beginners should stop trading until there is a clear breakout. Experienced traders will sometimes buy below bars and sell above bars.
bar pullback|In an upswing, a bar pullback is a bar with a low below the low of the prior bar. In a downswing, it is a bar with a high above that of the prior bar.
